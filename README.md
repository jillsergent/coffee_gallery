Coffee Gallery

My coffee is my daily ritual and it is sacred to me. I have my favorite shops to stop in on my way to the office during the week, sharing a moment with the baristas I've gotten to know. On the weekends, my coffee is made to the sweet sounds of a murder podcast (if you're in the market, I recommend Casefile). I'm a die-hard espresso drinker and look forward to one day having the home machine of my dreams. Until then, I decided to theme this Code Kentucky project around my favorite part of my day. I hope you'll explore while sipping your favorite brew!
